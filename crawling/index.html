      <h1>Lessons of learning front-side crawling</h1>

<p class="datetag">29 March 2013</p>

<p>
German by origin I was not taught front-side crawling until one rather depressing lesson towards the end of secondary school. <i>You want me to swim with my head in the water facing downwards, no thank you I think I will pass on that. I'd rather keep the breast-stroke style that is designed to keep my head out of the water (i.e. avoid drowning).</i> Lately though, I have taken to addressing this big gap in my swimming education and pushed my comfort to learn the arguably most efficient swimming technique. As a result of a good three months work with one day a week of exercise I have come from a pitiful first attempt that left me spluttering for breath after not even half a lane, to a still somewhat pitiful state where I can do four lanes in one go without falling apart. Below is a number of observations (and facetious morales) of what I have observed about myself and others.
</p>

<h5>1. The value of breath</h5>

<p>
With the very first attempt it hit me that any kind of crawling hinges on breathing or more precisely not drowning. Forget all about arm movement, foot movement, speed, everything but the one thing: have to be able to breath. Not just once but reliable without gulping down loads of gratuitous water.
</p>

<p><i>
Morale: Gain control of the fundamental blowout risks of any enterprise as a primal priority, only once this has been achieved focus on anything else.
</i></p>

<h5>2. Technique over strength</h5>

<p>

</p>

<p><i>
Morale: The elimination of huge waste through non-existent process is fundamental to performance. 
</i></p>

<h5>3. The virtues of moderation</h5>

<p>
</p>

<p><i>
Morale: 
</i></p>

<h5>4. The icing of footwork</h5>

<p>
</p>

<p><i>
No morale yet.
</i></p>

<h5>5. Improvement is always outside the comfort zone</h5>

<p>
</p>

<p><i>
Morale: To achieve anything worthwhile, determination and focus are essential. Nothing of value is learnt without leaving the comfort zone at just about every turn.
