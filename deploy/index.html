<h1>Hot deployment in Clojure</h1>

<p class="datetag">12 April 2014</p>

<p>
  <i>
    Note that a few points below are based on experiences in Clojure
    1.2.1. While that version is considerably dated, due to
    incompatible change barrier of version 1.3.0 early production
    adapters are sometimes still stuck on 1.2.1. Hence support for version
    1.2.1 remains a vital consideration imho.

<h2>The grail of on-the-fly deployment</h2>

<p>
  Given increasingly always on deployment requirements of modern
  applications as well as the expectation of live, REPL-based
  development modern language have increasingly embedded reloading &
  redeployment concepts in the core of the language.  To see the
  progress just contrast the ceremony of pure Java class reloading in
  development via elaborate add on tools like JRebel to the simplicity
  of a REPL such as in Clojure.
</p>

<p>
  However, speed of feedback during development is only one area
  unlocked by modern languages. Live redeployment of code in production
  where leveraging dynamic by nature languages can greatly help achieve
  agility and delivery. 
</p>

<p>
  In the Java world redeployment can be achieved live via carefully
  engineered classloader based mechanism (either written from scratch or
  employing the likes of OSGi bundle reload using probably the service
  registry to swap out the components). In Clojure simpler models are
  available via REPL like code replacement. Below I list some
  experiences of working on a dynamic deployment system in Clojure.
</p>


<h2>A. Reloading namespaces</h2>

<p>
  The simplest way to achieve code reload is simply to load the new
  code via any of the clojure.core load functions (load-reader,
  load-file). This will redefine definitions of the re-loaded
  namespace. Additionally if files are updated on the local file
  system require with :reload-all would also serve, with the added
  benefits of automatically handling full dependency refresh. 
</p>

<p>
  In the following sections we will assume stateless code (for which
  Clojure's functional paradigm is ideally suited anyway).  Reloading
  with the added complexity of maintaining in-memory state is best
  left aside to externalized caches.
</p>

<h3>To remove or not to remove</h3>

<p>
  Both of the options above will not remove a namespace before loading
  new definitions. This usually works quite well for small incremental
  code changes, during the duration of the reload symbols are either
  from the old namespace or redefined from the new namespace but
  functions can generally be used without interruption of
  service. However, this is not guaranteed and certain code changes
  will certainly mean execution of code and reloading cannot be
  interleaved safely. 
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, simply reloading over the top of an existing namespace
  without explicit calls to remove-ns will mean variables will not
  actually be removed, so functions that depend on removed
  functionality may appear to still work even though the functionality
  is actually broken. Furthermore, memory will not be reclaimed for
  big variables until an actual JVM restart.
</p>

<p>
  On the flip side a call to remove-ns followed by loading the new
  code will constitute a small duration of service disruption of
  external calls or internal code relying on the namespace.
</p>

<h3>Caveat: Memory leaks</h3>

<p>
  Although generally reloading namespaces should not create leakages
  as old bindings are replaced by new bindings, freeing the old data
  and code to be garbage collected, there are some scenarios that do
  create leaks.  One example (in Clojure 1.2.1 fixed in later versions)
  are defrecords. 
</p>

<p>
  As part of the definition of the record, Clojure 1.2.1 registers a
  multimethod for print-method against the record class.  Even after
  the namespace has been reloaded and the old class reference
  discarded this method definition will be kept by the Multimethod
  dispatch table and hence the record class and its classloader will
  be retained.
</p>

<h3>Caveat: defmacro race condition</h3>

<p>
  As hinted above reloading code concurrent to normal operations of
  the system can lead to race conditions, even in a generally
  concurrency-aware language such as Clojure. One particular example
  are macros (as created by defmacro). The definition of a macro is
  split into two parts (not combined as a single, atomic update at the
  time of this writing): the definition of function and binding to the
  appropriat Var, the setting of the macro meta flag.
</p>

<p>
  Because the two operations are performed non-atomically,
  concurrently compiling code can in rare cases see a version of the
  macro not marked as a macro and hence try to call the macro as a
  function.  Given the hidden additional env parameters passed to
  macros, this will inevitably lead to a rather weird compilation or
  execution failure. Even worse, with omission of an appropriate
  :refer-clojure clause it is even possible inadvertently to affect
  the macro status of core functions (a concurrent of a namespace without
  refer-clojure clause will rebind all Var to the clojure.core
  versions, so the call to set the macro flag may act on the
  clojure.core version if reload happens between the two definition steps).
</p>


<h2>B. Classloader reloading</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes reloading individual just is not enough. For example,
  completely refreshing a set of libraries while clearing out all
  previous Vars may be best achieved by dumping the whole Clojure
  installation.  For this task as well as the related concern of
  supporting different versions of the Clojure runtime itself, be it
  sequentially or concurrently, a Classloader based model - back to
  the Java roots so to say - seems unavoidable.  Unfortunately,
  Clojure in its current form offers a number of challenges.  See for
  example Immutant's article on runtime isolation <a href="http://immutant.org/news/2012/05/18/runtime-isolation/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A rough draft of how this could work, for the example of invoking a
  function with a set of arguments against a classloader (containing a
  Clojure runtime with any desired user libraries) is shown
  below. The reflection can be eliminated by using a tool like
  Shimdandy <a href="https://github.com/projectodd/shimdandy">Shimdandy</a></li>.
</p>

<pre>
<code>(defmacro with-thread-context-classloader [classloader & code]
  `(let [t# (Thread/currentThread)
         old-tcc# (.getContextClassLoader t#)]
     (try 
       (.setContextClassLoader t# ~classloader)
       ~@code
       (finally
         (.setContextClassLoader t# old-tcc#)))))

(defn- invoke-method [^Method m obj & args]
  (.invoke m obj (into-array Object args)))

(defn- cleanout-threadlocal [class-loader class field]
  (let [c (.loadClass class-loader class)
        f (.getDeclaredField c field)
        _ (.setAccessible f true)]
    (.remove (.get f nil))))

(defn- run [^ClassLoader class-loader namespace function arguments]
  (with-thread-context-classloader
    class-loader
    (let [rt (.loadClass class-loader "clojure.lang.RT")
          m (.getMethod rt "var" (into-array Class [String String]))
          
          f (invoke-method m nil namespace function)
          deser (invoke-method m nil "clojure.core" "read-string")
          seqer (invoke-method m nil "clojure.core" "seq")

          nssym (.invoke (invoke-method m nil "clojure.core" "symbol") namespace)]
      (.invoke (invoke-method m nil "clojure.core" "require") nssym)
      (let [res (->> arguments
                     (.invoke deser)
                     (.invoke seqer)
                     (.applyTo f))]

        ;; clean up 
        ;; shutdown agents, in case we created threads, makes the classloader onetime only
        (.invoke (invoke-method m nil "clojure.core" "shutdown-agents"))
        
        (cleanout-threadlocal class-loader "clojure.lang.Var" "dvals")
        (cleanout-threadlocal class-loader "clojure.lang.LockingTransaction" "transaction")
        (cleanout-threadlocal class-loader "clojure.lang.Agent" "nested")

        res))))
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  As noted in the Immutant article's comments even clearing out the
  threadlocals (on the invoking thread) and shuting down agents
  (making the classloader quite one time) is not necessarily enough to
  prevent leakage under the presence of any kind of binding on
  additionally created threads (or Clojure managed threads). Also,
  note that the return values should be converted to Java primitives
  to avoid classes spilling out (and being hung onto like it appears
  to be the case for nrepl).
