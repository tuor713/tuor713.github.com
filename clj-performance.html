<h2>Clojure performance investigation</h2>

<p>
A play around with Clojure sequence processing optimizations. All examples are taken from dual core MacBook Pro using the <a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">Criterium</a> library.
</p>

<p>
As an example I took this very naive CSV parsing code. 
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (let [[header & content] (.split s "\n")
        keys (map keyword (.split header ","))]
    (for [line content]
      (zipmap keys (.split line ",")))))
</pre>

<p>
Running this on an example input files of a 1000 lines of three
integer entries each:
</p>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 12360 in 60 samples of 206 calls.
Execution time mean : 5.082378 ms
Execution time std-deviation : 169.584800 us
</pre>
</p>

<p>
While that is not utterly attrocious, 5ms is by no means a particularly
awe-inspiring time for reading and splitting a thousand lines of
text. Surprisingly, the biggest hit is due simply to Java reflection
on String#split calls.
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (let [[header & content] (.split ^String s "\n")
        keys (map keyword (.split ^String header ","))]
    (for [line content]
      (zipmap keys (.split ^String line ",")))))
</pre>

<p>
Results are much better:
</p>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 34920 in 60 samples of 582 calls.
Execution time mean : 1.702471 ms
Execution time std-deviation : 16.062975 us
</pre>

<p>
However the type hints are quite intrusive and can be more
idiomatically avoided by using the clojure.string functions. Each of
these already has the appropriate type hints. Furthermore, the use of
regular expression literals avoids repeated recompilation of the
pattern and so slices off another bit of overhead.
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (let [[header & content] (split s #"\n")
        keys (map keyword (split header #","))]
    (for [line content]
      (zipmap keys (split line #",")))))
</pre>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 45180 in 60 samples of 753 calls.
Execution time mean : 1.345969 ms
Execution time std-deviation : 15.386283 us
</pre>

<p>
A further possible optimization is to define a struct up front to
avoid storage overheads and streamline the common datastructure parts.
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (let [[header & content] (split s #"\n")
        keys (map keyword (split header #","))
        s (apply create-struct keys)]
    (for [line content]
      (apply struct s (split line #",")))))
</pre>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 64260 in 60 samples of 1071 calls.
Execution time mean : 932.391208 us
Execution time std-deviation : 11.852525 us
</pre>

<p>
On the other hand (at least naive) parallelization has but a
detrimental effect, undoubtedly due to the unfavorable ration of
parallezitation overhead versus time taken by the line processing.
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (let [[header & content] (split s #"\n")
        keys (map keyword (split header #","))
        s (apply create-struct keys)]
    (pmap
      #(apply struct s (split line #","))
      content)))
</pre>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 16560 in 60 samples of 276 calls.
Execution time mean : 3.677696 ms
Execution time std-deviation : 136.358896 us
</pre>

<p>
On the other hand there seems to be a small gain from using a
transient structure to collate result rows. Note that with this change
the operation is no longer lazy, which restricts its use for streaming
through larger data sets.
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (let [[header & content] (split s #"\n")
        keys (map keyword (split header #","))
        s (apply create-struct keys)
        res (transient [])]
    (doseq [line content]
      (conj! res (apply struct s (split line #","))))
    (persistent! res)))
</pre>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 64440 in 60 samples of 1074 calls.
Execution time mean : 922.896151 us
Execution time std-deviation : 8.132084 us
</pre>

<p>
On the subject of behaviour changing alterations, there is also a
significant speed up from using seqs (returned from split) over
hash-maps.
</p>

<pre class="brush: clj">
(defn parse-csv [s]
  (for [line (split s #"\n")]
    (split line #",")))
</pre>

<pre>
Evaluation count : 86700 in 60 samples of 1445 calls.
Execution time mean : 694.440254 us
Execution time std-deviation : 3.447771 us
</pre>

<p>
As a final comparison running a similar Java program for parsing the
csv file into a List of arrays, a List of Lists came down as 370 resp. 384
us (using Pattern#split rather than the less effective
String#split). So overall Clojure is in the same ballpark. Using
looping instead of sequence traversal would probably bring timings
even closer together, at the expense of neatness and readability though.
</p>

<h2> Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reflections sucks.</li>
  <li>Use clojure.string whenever possible</li>
  <li>Use structs (or records) when performance really matters.</li>
</ul>
