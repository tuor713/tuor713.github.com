<h2>The odds of lottery</h2>

<p class="datetag">29 March 2013</p>

<p>
Not being a lottery player myself there are a couple of odd bits I find interesting about the concept and the usual behaviour around lottery. Let's start with the basics.
</p>

<h5>The chance of winning</h5>

<p>
For a standard 5-out-of-49 style lottery the chance of hitting the right five numbers is 1 in 49*48*47*46*45 = 228826080, so roughly 200 million to one. With an extra ball for the jackpot, which is a one in ten, it becomes 1 in 49*48*47*46*45*10 = 2288260800, so about in one against 2 billion.
</p>

<h5>The best strategy for hitting the jackpot</h5>

<p>
If your goal is to hit the big jackpot, then (not unlike best strategies in a casino) your best bet is to put it all on one go (presumably one with a very large jackpot). Consider for example the odds of winning with two lottery tickets are 2 in 228826080, roughly 0.00000000874026247. On the other hand the chances of winning with buying a single ticket in two separate lotteries is equal to (leaving out the infinitesimal chance of winning both) 1 - (228826079/228826080)^2, roughly 0.00000000874026245. A minute difference, but consider buying a thousand tickets it is 0.00000437013 versus 0.00000437012 and with a million tickets even 0.00437 versus 0.00436. A small percentage loss for every extra time you play. Admittedly, tiny versus the odds of winning at all. Now the extreme case is that of buying all tickets, on the one hand you win with 100% chance, in the other case (including rounding precision problems) something like 63% a big discrepancy ...
